# Smart-DataOps-Copilot  

## Phase 1 â€” ETL Pipeline Development  

The primary objective of **Phase 1** is to build a **scalable ETL pipeline** that enables users to ingest data from multiple sources (initially **CSV uploads** and **REST APIs**) into a **PostgreSQL database**. This forms the foundation for all subsequent phases of the project.  

---

### Key Features  

1. **Schema Inference & Validation**  
   - Automatically detect schema (column names, datatypes, nullability).  
   - Validate schema consistency and handle mismatches.  
   - Standardize column naming conventions.  

2. **Data Processing with PySpark**  
   - Use **PySpark** for ingestion and transformation, ensuring scalability.  
   - Perform data cleaning: null handling, type casting, duplicates removal.  
   - Support both **batch ingestion** (CSV) and **streaming ingestion** (REST API).  

3. **Database Integration (PostgreSQL)**  
   - Dynamically create new tables for each ingested dataset.  
   - Store data in optimized formats (partitioning/indexing strategies considered).  
   - Provide configurable load modes: **overwrite**, **append**, and **upsert**.  

4. **Metadata Management**  
   - Maintain a **metadata catalog** storing:  
     - Dataset name  
     - Schema details  
     - Record counts  
     - Null distributions  
     - Unique value stats  
   - Enable metadata to be queried later for **data discovery and AI-driven insights**.  

5. **Extensibility & Modularity**  
   - Modular pipeline architecture for supporting future data sources (e.g., Kafka, cloud storage).  
   - Pluggable ingestion layer to abstract source-specific logic.

### Expected Outcome  

By the end of Phase 1, the system will:  
- Allow users to upload CSV files or connect to REST APIs as data sources.  
- Automatically infer, validate, and transform schemas with PySpark.  
- Load cleaned data into PostgreSQL with dynamic table creation.  
- Store dataset metadata for governance and future exploration.  

This robust ETL foundation will serve as the backbone for upcoming phases, including **advanced transformations, workflow orchestration, AI-powered data exploration, and a user-facing interface**.

### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps (Future Phases)  
- Orchestration with **Airflow**.  
- Enhanced data quality checks.  
- Real-time streaming pipelines.  
- AI-assisted query generation.  
- Web-based dashboard for data interaction.
